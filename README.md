Within this thesis the author has developed and implemented a system for peer review  
of application source code. This is not another system that just supporting peer review  
as understood in the dictionary. System has been adapted to the realities of learning process  
in schools.  
  
By carrying out specific requirements such as „review must be anonymous” or „review  
is supervised by the person leading the course”, assisted review move away from the  
definition. The author is deeply convinced that performing peer review while learning,  
not only by course leader, but also by colleagues positively affect the efficiency of removal  
of defects and will speed up learning courve. This system is to create opportunities.  
Student reviews friend's code by filling previously prepared, by trainer, form.  
  
The system has been implemented as a Web application. Software reusable is very  
important in that system. It deeply integrates with one of commonly used version control  
system - Git and a GitHub service. Course leader can easily start using this system and  
does not have to give up already using tools.
